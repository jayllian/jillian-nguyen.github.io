    #this portion is written in TOML (Tom's Obvious Minimal Language)
    
    title = "Dirty Computer"
    #replace takes the filename and replaces all hyphens with spaces so that when it appears on your page, it's using spaces. The filename is used in the URL and URLs can't have spaces so use hyphen in the filename.
    #title converts to title-case (using capital letters for principal words only)

    projectVideo = ""
    #Project video is just the unique part of the URL  
    # For example, if the link is https://vimeo.com/285189099 then the unique part is  285189099
    projectVideoType = ""
    #Enter "youtube" or "vimeo". You can add other video types as well by editing single.html 
    projectImage = "dirty_computer_album.jpg"
    #Enter the filename only. For example, "metropolis_album.jpg" 
    #This image should be saved in the project folder with the name of your project

    #Alt text is the text that gets read by screenreaders for accessibility (typically for the visually impaired)
